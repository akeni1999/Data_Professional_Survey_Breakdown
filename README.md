# Data Professional Survey Breakdown Analysis

### Situation

- The goal of the project is to analyze the survey data from data professionals to uncover valuable insights about the data industry.
- These findings are useful for individuals seeking to better understand their position within the industry and for organizations looking to attract and retain talented data professionals.

### Task

- My role in the project was to look at various parameters like salary by job title, happiness with work/life balance, happiness with salary, what are the favorite programming languages of these data professionals and how hard is it to break into the field of data.
- My aim was to create an interactive dashboard that would convey important points regarding data professionals.

### Action

I have created an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes the survey data, allowing the user to delve into the findings in a comprehensive way. I have worked on various parameters which are as follows:

- **Country Distribution**: The dashboard visually represents the countries where the survey was taken. It helps understand the geographical distribution of survey participants and identifies regions with significant data professional presence.
- **Average Salary by Job Title**: This section provides an overview of the average salary based on different job titles. It allows for comparisons between job roles and helps identify positions with higher wages within the data professional community.
- **Total Count of Survey Takers**: The dashboard features a visualization that showcases the total count of survey takers. This metric provides an understanding of the sample size and the extent of the survey's reach within the data professional population.
- **Average Age of Survey Takers**: In this section, the dashboard presents the average age of the survey takers. It offers insights into the age distribution of data professionals and helps identify age-related trends or preferences.
- **Average Rating of Survey Takers' Happiness:** The dashboard includes a rating scale from 0 to 10, where survey takers rate their happiness level. The average happiness rating provides an overall understanding of job satisfaction within the data professional community.
- **Favorite Programming Languages**: This section highlights the favorite programming languages chosen by survey takers. The visualization helps identify the most popular languages among data professionals, enabling organizations to align their technology stacks accordingly.
- **Difficulty in Breaking into Data:** The dashboard analyzes the perceived problem in breaking into the data field. The options provided include "neither easy nor difficult," "difficult," "easy," "very difficult," and "very easy." This information helps understand the challenges aspiring data professionals face and provides insights into the barriers to entry.
- **Average Happiness with Salary:** The dashboard presents a rating scale from 0 to 10, where survey takers rate their happiness with their current salary. The average rating helps assess the satisfaction level of data professionals regarding their compensation.

### Result
